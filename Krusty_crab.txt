Under the sea, where the ocean is vast,
There's a place where good times always last.
The Krusty Krab, a beacon so bright,
Serving Krabby Patties, morning and night.

SpongeBob flips burgers with expert care,
While Squidward's grumbles fill the salty air.
Mr. Krabs counts his money with glee,
In this underwater culinary spree.

Customers come from near and far,
To taste the wonders of the Krabby star.
So if youâ€™re ever in Bikini Bottom's land,
Visit the Krusty Krab, where meals are grand.
